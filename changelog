;;;	Update history:
;;;
;;; DD/MM/YY
;;; 10/11/12	Redefined methods of the generic function EXPAND-FIXTURE to specialize on the test suite name instead of class to solve some fringe cases with unintended effects. [THMG]
;;;
;;; 17/11/12	Reduced the use of generic functions internally, now its a combination of hash table lookups and stored objects.
;;;				Added support for explicit function test dependency declarations.
;;;				Added support for automatic re-run of failed tests via (RERUN-FAILED-TESTS)
;;;				[THMG]
;;;
;;; 18/11/12	Added extra assertion test forms: ASSERT-EQUALITY and ASSERT-FAIL. [THMG]
;;;
;;; 20/12/12	Added functions to query various information about the defined test cases and test suites e.g. returning a list of all defined test names. [THMG]
;;;
;;; 03/01/13	Defined a new macro UNDEFFIXTURE which is used to undefine a previously defined test suite fixture.
;;;				Updated the documentation to include a new entry for the UNDEFFIXTURE macro.
;;;				Modified the default error reporting function so that it skips the detailed failure reports section if there is nothing to report.
;;;				Tweaked the reporting of ASSSERT-TRUE to say 'Expected: (NOT NIL)' instead of 'Expected: T', since it expects a generalized boolean.
;;;				BUGFIX: The functions RUN-TEST and RERUN-FAILED-TESTS were using the undefined variable *QUEUED-TESTS* instead of *QUEUED-TEST-REPORTS*
